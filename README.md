# School_management_system
Welcome to the School Management System project! This project is designed to help manage student details such as adding new students, finding student details by roll number or semester, updating student details, and deleting student records. This is my first project in the C programming language.

<h2>Project Description</h2>
The School Management System is a console-based application developed in C that allows users to perform various operations related to student management. The primary functionalities include:

1. Add New Student Details: Add details of a new student, including first name, last name, roll number, phone number, and semester.
2. Find Student Details by Roll Number: Retrieve and display details of a student based on their roll number.
3. Find Students by Semester: List all students enrolled in a particular semester.
4. Delete Student Details: Remove a student's details from the records based on their roll number.
5. Update Student Details: Update specific details of a student, such as their name, roll number, phone number, or semester.
6. Exit: Exit the application.

<h2>Usage</h2>
To use this application, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler, for example, gcc.
3. Run the compiled executable to start the application.
